            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2> Context</h2>
            <p> Me and partner for this project were supposed to be making a made up movie webpage about whatever we wanted using pretty much the most significant elements we learned about HTML and CSS. So, the movie we decided to make was a thriller that is actually based off of an arc, or season if you will in the anime "One Piece", but we ended up naming it "Lost Bark" and making it our own. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> For the HTML elements we had to include the following: <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> heading(s) </li>
                    <li> paragraph(s)</li>
                    <li> div(s) and pan(s)</li>
                    <li> google font(s) that haven't been used in class</li>
                    <li> input(s) and submit</li>
                </ul>
            <p> For the CSS though, we had to include: <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>selectors:element and class and id</li>
                    <li>box model: padding and border and margin</li>
                </ul>
            <p> We also had to add creative commons (or original) images, we had to include at least 2, and they had to be local. Obviously we had to have partner evaluation as well, so that was it for what we had to include. Now lets move on to the reflection. </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> The first challenge me and partner had was with trying to find a place to put the `id` attritbute because we had everything but that, so the id attribute didn't work no matter where we put it. Then, we remembered how the id attrbute only is for one specific word, so we put it for a word that we only used once and it worked.</p>
            <p> Another challenge that we had was that no matter how many times I clicked on our link to the website, it couldn't load in. So I tried to make a different yellkey, it didn't work. Thought I used the wrong link, and it still didn't work. But, when I told my partner to change the yellkey instead since he created the pickcode, it finally worked.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p> I learned more about how to use an `id` attribute through having trouble trying to only use it for a word that was said in our website once, and about it's significance in CSS that I completely forgot about in our last lessons. This was how the `id` attribute is one of the more important elements that can override CSS. </p>            
            <p>It also made me want to use slack more because with slack, you and your partner, or just classmates in general, can chat with each other about updates/ catching each other up. </p>
            <p> Also to make a plan.md before your project so you can know who is doing what since that's what everybody did for their project, and it helped me and my partner with us just not being random and doing a poor job.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p> The next steps are to attach this project to my portfolio which is what I am doing at the moment while I'm typing this right now, since I've already finished with my movie webpage and my sequel webpage. </p>
